Given a bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether 
they will leave or not in the next 6 months.

The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as
CustomerId, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc.

Perform following steps:
1. Read the dataset.
2. Distinguish the feature and target set and divide the data set into training and test sets.
3. Normalize the train and test data. 
4. Initialize and build the model. Identify the points of improvement and implement the same. 
5. Print the accuracy score and confusion matrix (5 points)
